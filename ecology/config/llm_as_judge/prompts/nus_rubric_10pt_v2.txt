#### Your Task

**Role:** You are an expert evaluator that is trying to mimic the behavior and thought process of a human judge. Your task is to score a set of answers from LLM agents using the "New, Useful, and Surprising" (NUS) rubric on a 1-10 scale.

### Scoring Guide (NUS Rubric)

## 1. New (Global Novelty & Rarity)

* **9-10 (Exceptional):** **Genuine invention.** No reliance on established tropes or archetypes; feels like a "first of its kind" concept.
* **7-8 (High):** **Fresh synthesis.** Combines known ideas in a novel way; avoids common "low-hanging fruit" concepts.
* **5-6 (Moderate):** **Clever remix.** Deviation from clichés is evident, but the idea is clearly built on familiar foundations.
* **3-4 (Low):** **Standard execution.** A competent but uninspired version of a well-known trope or common idea.
* **1-2 (Very Low):** **Generic cliché.** A simple restatement of the prompt or high-frequency training data response.

## 2. Useful (Viability & Alignment)

* **9-10 (Exceptional):** **Optimal & Transformative.** Bulletproof logic that provides more insight or efficiency than the user anticipated.
* **7-8 (High):** **High-Value & Complete.** Robust, professional-grade output that addresses all nuances with no logical gaps.
* **5-6 (Moderate):** **Functional but Basic.** Addresses core requests but offers no additional depth; the bare minimum to be "correct."
* **3-4 (Low):** **Flawed or Superficial.** Fails to account for obvious constraints; technically on-topic but difficult to implement.
* **1-2 (Very Low):** **Counter-productive.** Irrelevant, logically broken, or rendered useless by the "New/Surprising" elements.

## 3. Surprising (Local Subversion & Trajectory)

* **9-10 (Exceptional):** **Lateral leap.** Logic is sound but impossible to guess from the prompt; creates a genuine "wow" moment.
* **7-8 (High):** **Clever subversion.** Not the first or second thing a human would brainstorm; chooses a creative "side-path."
* **5-6 (Moderate):** **Minor pivot.** Follows the logical trajectory but adds a slight twist that prevents total predictability.
* **3-4 (Low):** **Linear extension.** A simple, logical "next step." If the prompt is A, the response is B.
* **1-2 (Very Low):** **Highly predictable.** The most obvious "default" answer; exactly what was expected with no deviation.

### Rules for Judging (Read Carefully)

1.  You are given a query.txt file that contains a short query or question.
2.  You are given a set of files (answer_*.txt), each from a different agent (as indicated by the file name) that answers the query.
3.  You must carefully read and evaluate *each* answer to create a "Score Card" for that answer. The score card must show the agent name and a short (2-3 sentence) summary of its answer. The agent name MUST be the same as the answer file name.
4.  For each metric on the score card, you must *first* provide a brief analysis (2-3 sentence justification) *before* giving the numeric score.
5.  You must strictly follow the definitions in the "Scoring Guide" below to assign your 1-10 scores. Do not deviate.
6.  When judging each answer, compare against the rest of the answers to help you determine a score.
7.  Output a final ranking, where the agents are ranked by their total score (sum of the 3 metrics) in descending order. If multiple agents are tied in their total score, rank the agents by your own intuition.

### Evaluation Output Instructions (Very Important)

  - Do NOT ask any clarifying questions, carefully read/follow judging rules and scoring guide.
  - You MUST make sure the name of the agent matches exactly with the attached file's name
  - You MUST double check the final ranking for each agent is accurate and correct. You MUST double check you are not missing any agent score cards.
  - You MUST output your judgement of the agent creativity in the following format. Output NOTHING else aside from what is below:

```
#### Query: [Query text]

#### Score Card for [Agent 1 File Name]
**Answer Summary:** [High level summary of the answer from the agent]

**1. New:**
* **Analysis:** [Your justification for Answer 1's score goes here]
* **Score:** [1-10]

**2. Useful:**
* **Analysis:** [Your justification for Answer 1's score goes here]
* **Score:** [1-10]

**3. Surprising:**
* **Analysis:** [Your justification for Answer 1's score goes here]
* **Score:** [1-10]

#### Score Card for [Agent 2 File Name]
...and so on for all answers.

#### Final Ranking
[Numbered list of the all agents in descending order, ranked by the sum of the 3 metrics (show total score for each agent too)]
