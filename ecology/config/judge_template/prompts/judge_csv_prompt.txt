### YOUR TASK ###

Attached are results from multiple judges (judge_[...]) where each judge scored the creativity of answers from different agents (answer_[...]) on various queries (using 3 metrics: new, surprising, useful). Create an easy to understand yet detailed and informative summary of the scores from each agent.

Generate a CSV showing all the scoring results (use example below as an template, but do NOT copy the scores from it):

Query,Agent,Judge,New,Useful,Surprising,Total
constrained_creativity,answer_agent1,judge_claude,1,1,1,3
counterfactual_reasoning,answer_agent2,judge_claude,2,2,2,6
crossdomain_synthesis,answer_agent1,judge_gemini,3,3,3,9
meta_creativity,answer_agent2,judge_claude,4,4,4,12
openended_creativity,answer_agent3,judge_gpt,5,5,5,15

IMPORTANT: You must double check that the generated CSV is accurate and that no entries are omitted.
IMPORTANT: The judge scores of each agent answer must be assigned to one of the following 5 query categories: constrained_creativity, counterfactual_reasoning, crossdomain_synthesis, openended_creativity
