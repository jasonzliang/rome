### The 5-Phase Web Exploration Policy

#### Phase 1: Query Relaxation (The "Fuzzy" Search)
**The Logic:** Precise queries yield precise, but often narrow, results. To find new insights, we must first widen the aperture.
* **The Agent Instruction:** Do not start with a specific question like "What is the optimal batch size?" Instead, start with a **Contextual Hypothesis**. Map the surrounding territory.
* **The Action:** Generate 3 distinct search queries:
    1.  *The Direct:* The obvious search terms.
    2.  *The Adjacent:* Concepts *related* to the topic but not directly about it.
    3.  *The Broad:* The fundamental principles underlying the topic.

#### Phase 2: High-Entropy Navigation (The Serendipity Walk)
**The Logic:** Search engines are biased toward consensus and popularity (PageRank). Creative insight often lives in the "long tail"—blogs, forums, and niche papers.
* **The Agent Instruction:** Prioritize **Information Diversity**. Do not just scrape the top 3 snippets. actively seek "Heretical" sources.
* **The Action:**
    * *Lateral Clicking:* Follow links that move *away* from the central topic (e.g., if researching "AI Efficiency," click a link about "Biological Thermodynamics").
    * *Source Variance:* If you have read a corporate whitepaper, you *must* next find a Reddit thread or an individual developer's blog on the same topic to get the raw, unpolished perspective.

#### Phase 3: Knowledge Graph Synthesis (The Sketch)
**The Logic:** Browsing without memory is wasted. The agent must collapse its diverse reading into a structured model.
* **The Agent Instruction:** Construct a temporary **Knowledge Graph**. Connect the concepts you found in Phase 2.
* **The Action:** Summarize the findings, but focusing on **Relationships**. How does Concept A (from the whitepaper) relate to Concept B (from the forum)? This synthesis is the "Prototype" of understanding.

#### Phase 4: Conflict Mining (The Dissonance Signal)
**The Logic:** Most agents summarize consensus ("Most sources say X"). A creative agent looks for the fight ("Source A says X, but Source B implies Y").
* **The Agent Instruction:** Scan your Knowledge Graph for **inconsistencies, gaps, and contradictions**.
* **The Action:** Identify the "Negative Space."
    * *The Gap:* What question is nobody answering?
    * *The Conflict:* Where do two credible sources totally disagree?
    * *The Tension:* This disagreement is not an error; it is the "Dissonance Signal" that reveals where the real insight is hiding.

#### Phase 5: Query Evolution (The Pivot)
**The Logic:** We do not refine the answer; we evolve the question.
* **The Agent Instruction:** Use the "Dissonance" from Phase 4 to generate the search queries for the next loop.
* **The Action:** Your new search query should target the *conflict* you found.
    * *Old Query:* "How to bake bread."
    * *Conflict Found:* Recipes differ on humidity.
    * *Evolved Query:* "Impact of atmospheric humidity on yeast fermentation rates."
* **The Result:** You are no longer searching for the original topic; you have transcended it to explore the underlying mechanics.
